I want to create a backend service for a round based question game.
coded in kotlin and Ktor.
the game is played by a teacher and students.
the teacher can create a game and the students can join the game.
the teacher can start the game and the students can answer the questions.
after the game is finished all can see the results.
the teacher only presses start and press next question.
after the teacher presses start, the question is presented at the teacher screen
and the answers need to be given to the students.

### To create a backend service for this round-based question game using Kotlin and Ktor, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the project and dependencies**
2. **Create models for game, teacher, and student**
3. **Create data access objects (DAOs) for the models**
4. **Define the routes for the game API**
5. **Implement the game logic and endpoints**

Here's a basic outline of what your project could look like:

1. **Set up the project and dependencies**
    - Create a new Kotlin project with Ktor and configure your build.gradle.kts file to include the necessary
      dependencies such as Ktor, kotlinx.serialization, and a database driver (e.g., H2 or PostgreSQL)

2. **Create models for game, teacher, and student**
    - Game: gameId, teacherId, gameState, currentQuestion, questions, results
    - Teacher: teacherId, name
    - Student: studentId, name, gameId

3. **Create data access objects (DAOs) for the models**
    - Define interfaces for each DAO, such as GameDAO, TeacherDAO, and StudentDAO
    - Implement the DAOs, using a database of your choice for persistence

4. **Define the routes for the game API**
    - POST /teacher: create a new teacher
    - POST /student: create a new student
    - POST /game: create a new game (requires teacherId)
    - POST /game/{gameId}/join: join an existing game (requires studentId)
    - POST /game/{gameId}/start: start the game (requires teacherId)
    - POST /game/{gameId}/next: show the next question (requires teacherId)
    - POST /game/{gameId}/answer: submit an answer for the current question (requires studentId)
    - GET /game/{gameId}/results: get the game results

5. **Implement the game logic and endpoints**
    - Set up a Ktor server with routing and necessary features such as ContentNegotiation and StatusPages
    - Implement each of the routes, using your DAOs to interact with the data and enforce game rules
    - Ensure that the game state is updated correctly and that results are available once the game is finished
